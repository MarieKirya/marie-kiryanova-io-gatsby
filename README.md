Introduction
-------

This gatsby site was put together as an exercise in Gatsby and React. I'm fairly happy with how it turned out.

Installation
-------

1. Run `npm install` in the repo.
2. Make sure you have Gatsby CLI installed, `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
3. Run `gatsby develop` to run the site.
4. Run `npm run css-deploy` to build SCSS.
